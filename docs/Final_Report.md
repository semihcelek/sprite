# App Store Optimizations

Publishing the game on stores was the important aspect of developing a game. Optimizing and properly presenting the game was the vital part of the game development. Each application stores have their own characteristic and requires own AppStore Optimization. . 

## ASO for Sprinter Game

App Store Optimization played huge role on the success of publishing the game. It is almost mandatory to have proper App Store Optimization when listing game on store. Creating a unique impression in app stores played important role for audience for getting downloads. 

# Performance Datas

Performance datas for sprinter game unfortunately left limited. Due to the lack of data it wasn't healthy to make predictions.

# Conclusion & Final Words

In conclusion making a successful game has lot of steps and requirements. At first glance, it might be seem that developing a game was the most important aspect of the game development, but in reality it's much as important to have good publishing and marketing phase as having a good development phase. This project made me realize that, in order to have successful product, it's highly important to make plan for the project. It's valuable to create game design document and simple prototype for starter. Creating game design document allows us to understand the purpose and the boundaries of our game. Creating prototype game with primitive design approach allows us to whether our game is fun/enjoyable or not. Prototyping games are really important stage in game development because it helps us the decide whether we continue idea/design or not. It's also really fast and cost efficient approach in game development, it's easy to get things working and testing the game design that we try to create. 

When we try to create a game design, it's very easy to fall an idea that works in the game design but doesn't work when game is implemented. In order to prevent this happening, creating simple prototype is valid solution. In Sprinter game, I tried to implement basic game mechanics to test the gameplay. Prototype of the game was nothing more than a simple capsule and rectangle platform and positioning the camera. This approach immediately indicated that the game play that we desired in game design document was working. After that I stared work more. I got models and animations and implemented even more.

Making a game is one thing but publishing and marketing is another. After game is ready for the store publishing it was necessary to create store presentation for caching the intention of the audience. It's highly important to create interesting artwork, story, in-game scenes and setting proper key words and genre for the game. Creating an interesting and unique first impression of the game on the store listing is one of the important aspect which determines the succession of App Store Optimizations. 

With the help of the performance data, we keep improve our both game and app store listing presentations. Keeping track of the data enables us to compare our improvements whether they are working or not. And we decide next actions based on the solid data and statistics.

On the other hand monetization system in games enables us to make profit from game. In the mobile games we can make money with showing ads to our audience or encourage user to in-app purchases, also we can make our games paid application. In sprinter game monetization is implemented with ads. It's highly important to place ads in the game because if its too much, players will immediately leave the game, or if its too less, we cannot profit effectively. One of the way to balance for ads to give player choice to watch ads. For example, when the player dies in the game, offering a video add for restoring the game is valid implementation of showing ads. Players will likely to watch ads for regaining their position in the game. In this way we can profit efficiently and keep audience interested.

Lastly, making this game made me more interested in game development and understating the whole game development process really help me to grasp the fundamentals. Developing a game is not only coding for creating the game, it's more like a producing whole product and marketing it. There is much more than just creating the game. I will continue to game development but I probably will continue other projects to explore other types of game designs and mechanics.
